### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Taylor Bruun and I am currently learning software development at CodeWorks here in Boise, Idaho. I am a licended Idaho attorney and I am interested in becoming a full stack developer to bring my love from complex problem solving to an entierly different field! 

I am currently working on my C# and MySQL skills, and am using Vue as a frontend framework.

I have already studied HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Javascript, and NodeJS and the basics of frontend architecture in JavasScript. I have also taken a brief foray into Java for some personal projects.

Some of my current interests include the basics of managing client identity/connections, backend data structures, and the creative application of random number generation to solve a problem! 

Feel free to contact me via Email, taylorbruun@gmail.com, or search for me on slack!
